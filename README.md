# ✅ NVIDIA Financial Transparency Dashboard (Power BI)

## Overview
A Power BI project **in progress** designed to simulate NVIDIA-style financial analytics workflows.  
The goal is to demonstrate how **financial transparency and variance tracking** can be achieved through a well-structured data model and intuitive dashboard design.

---

## Objectives
- Build an **SAP-like star schema** integrating revenue, expense, and capital expenditure data.  
- Create **DAX-based KPIs** for Actual vs Budget Variance, YoY Growth, Gross Margin %, Expense Ratio, and CapEx Utilization.  
- Develop **interactive report pages** for Executive Overview, Segment Performance (Gaming, Data Center, Auto, ProViz), and Cost Center Variance.  
- Emphasize **data validation, documentation, and metric transparency**, aligning with best practices in FP&A reporting.

---

## Data Source
The dataset uses **simulated financial data modeled after public NVIDIA segment reports (10-K)** to illustrate reporting structure and financial relationships — no confidential or internal data is used.

---

## Current Status
- ✅ Data model design completed (`Fact_Finance`, `Dim_Time`, `Dim_Department`)  
- ✅ Preliminary KPI definitions written in DAX  
- 🏗️ Dashboard development and layout refinement in progress  

---

## Tech Stack
`Power BI` • `DAX` • `Excel / CSV` • `SAP-like schema design`

---

## Key Takeaways (Expected)
By the end of this project, the dashboard will:
- Demonstrate the candidate’s ability to connect **financial logic with analytical design**.  
- Highlight **data governance and transparency principles** emphasized in modern FP&A workflows.  
- Serve as a **proof-of-concept for scalable, finance-oriented BI reporting**.
