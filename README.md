# 📊 NVIDIA Financial Analytics Dashboard (Tableau)

## Overview

This project presents a multi-page Tableau dashboard designed to replicate an end-to-end NVIDIA-style financial analytics workflow.
It demonstrates the full FP&A reporting cycle—from revenue analysis to cost structure, cash flow, and working-capital insights—through a clean, intuitive, and highly transparent BI design.

Rather than showcasing raw charts, the dashboard emphasizes financial storytelling: helping users understand what changed, how it changed, and why it changed across NVIDIA’s quarterly performance.

## ✨ Objectives
- Build a finance-oriented analytical dashboard covering five perspectives:
(1) Executive Summary
(2) Revenue Analysis
(3) Earnings & Growth Drivers
(4) Cash Performance
(5) Working-Capital Efficiency

- Apply financial logic and FP&A best practices, including operating margin decomposition, expense ratio tracking, FCF trends, and working-capital cycle metrics.

- Create a scalable, transparent reporting structure, suitable for executive-level review or analyst-level variance investigation.

- Demonstrate BI development capability through clean layout, coordinated color themes, KPI cards, and multi-view drilldown.

## 🗂️ Data Model

The dataset is simulated based on the structure of NVIDIA’s public 10-K/10-Q disclosures.
It uses a simple star schema:
